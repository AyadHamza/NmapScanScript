<h1>Description<h1>
<b>The nmap script parses through an xml format nmap scan file, that has scanned the entire 10.0.0.0/24 network. It should essentially work with any one who uses it, but you will need to change the path to your own specific path to where your nmap scan is located on your local drive.The script essentially uses the "[xml]" accelerator to convert the xml file to the Document Object Model(DOM) for a more hierarchical strucuted to make it easier to parse through the nodes.</b>
